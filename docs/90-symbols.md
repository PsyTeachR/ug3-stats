## General notes

- Greek letters represent population parameter values; roman letters represent sample values.

- A Greek letter with a "hat" represents and *estimate* of the population value from the sample; i.e., $\mu_x$ represents the true population mean of $X$, while $\hat{\mu}_x$ represents its estimate from the sample.

## Table of symbols


|symbol            |pronunciation |definition                                                                                                      |
|:-----------------|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|$\mu$             |meeYU         |generally, a population mean; sometimes, a model intercept. $\mu_x$ represents the mean of x                    |
|$\sigma$          |sigma         |lower case sigma is the standard deviation; $\sigma_x$ is the standard deviation of $X$                         |
|$\sigma^2$        |sigma squared |variance                                                                                                        |
|$\rho$            |row           |population correlation; $\rho_{xy}$ is the correlation in the population between $X$ and $Y$                    |
|$r$               |row           |sample correlation; r_{xy} is the correlation in the sample between $X$ and $Y$                                 |
|$\mathbf{\Sigma}$ |sigma         |the capital letter sigma in boldface represents a variance-covariance matrix                                    |
|$\sum$            |sigma         |upper case sigma is an instruction to add; e.g., $\sum X_i$ is the instruction to sum together all values of X. |
|$\beta            |beta          |regression coefficient                                                                                          |
