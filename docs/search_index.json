Barr 2019-10-07 Overview This course teaches students how to translate psychological study designs into statistical models. The course adopts a General Linear Models approach, with an emphasis on data simulation, reproducibility, and transparency. Students will learn how to simulate and analyze data from many different common designs in psychology. 0.1 Course Aims To provide an understanding of the basic statistics appropriate to the analysis of psychological experiments. To learn how to produce reproducible scripts and reports using R and RMarkdown. 0.2 Intended Learning Outcomes By the end of this course students will be able to: Integrate knowledge about study design and statistics to formulate and estimate the General Linear Model (GLM) appropriate to the various types of study designs encountered in psychology, especially studies with repeated observations. Visualise and interpret various effects (including interactions) in multi-way designs. Estimate linear mixed-effects models and describe their relation to traditional techniques such as ANOVA and multiple regression. Perform logistic regression and explain and interpret the statistical output. Create reproducible data analysis scripts and reports within the R statistical programming environment. "],

This difficulty comes from the way statistics is taught. Open up many traditional textbooks for teaching statistics in Psychology, and you will often find a decision tree that looks something like this: if often taught as if you were giving people instructions for warming up pre-packaged meals. Pre-packaged foods solve an immediate, short-term problem: I am hungry, and I want something tasty and easy to prepare. I don't want to invest too much time, thought, or energy into it. I don't know anything about how the ingredients were chosen, nor about how it was prepared. In fact, the less I know about what I'm putting in my body, the better. This is a great approach to meeting your basic caloric needs and providing some quick gratification after a long day of work, but as anyone will tell you, is this the set of values that we want to have when we are producing or consuming scientific research? Microwave instructions for pre-packaged food. 2.2 Recipe-driven approaches &quot;If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail&quot; The real problem is this: the real data that you will encounter in your lifetime as a psychologist will be far more complex than the canned datasets you find in traditional statistics textbooks. Let's have a look at an example. violation of assumptions, especially: independence discretizing predictors treating categorical data as continuous over-aggregation mindless statistics 2.3 It's all just regression 2.4 The fundamental unity of all common statistical tests t-test correlation &amp; regression multiple regression analysis of variance mixed-effects modeling 2.5 The GLM approach Define a mathematical model describing the processes that give rise to the data Use your data to estimate model parameters Validate the model Report what you did as transparently as possible 2.6 Models are just... models A statistical model is a simplification and idealization of reality that captures our key assumptions about the Data Generating Process (the DGP). 2.7 Importance of data simulation 2.8 Case study: Stroop Effect data 2.8.1 t-test 2.8.2 analysis of variance 2.8.3 linear regression 2.8.4 multilevel model 2.9 Single-level versus multi-level data 2.10 Issues with multilevel data GLMs assume independence of residuals Observations within a cluster (unit) are not independent Any sources of non-independence must be modelled or &quot;aggregated away&quot; Typical consequence of failure to do so: High false-positive rates 2.11 Regression: Killer app (see slide 18) 2.12 Four functions to rule them all How is the data structured? What type of response variable? How are the observations distributed? "],
